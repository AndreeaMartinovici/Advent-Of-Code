1. Make sure your PR has two files, one for each part of the day
2. Make sure that it is in the correct folder
3. No need for an input file. I did not know that the input is different for each user
4. In your PR, end your message with `Close #{ISSUE_NUMBER}` where ISSUE_NUMBER is the number of the issue for this day

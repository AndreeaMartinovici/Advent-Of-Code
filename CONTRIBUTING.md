1. Make sure your PR has two files, one for each part of the day
2. Make sure that it is in the correct folder
3. No need for an input file. I did not know that the input is different for each user
4. In your PR, end your message with `Close #{ISSUE_NUMBER}` where ISSUE_NUMBER is the number of the issue for this day
5. Make sure that your solutions read the input from an external file. They should not be asking the user for input at runtime or have hardcoded input variables
6. If you have changed the input file's format in any way, then specify it in a comment in the solution
